## Getting to Berkeley
The nearest airports to Berkeley are San Francisco (SFO) and Oakland (OAK). The BART (local rapid transit) runs from both airports to Berkeley. From SFO, either take the red line directly to Berkeley, or take the yellow line and transfer to the orange line at MacArthur station. From OAK, take the beige line (airport connector) to Coliseum station and transfer to the orange line towards Richmond.

Once you're in Berkeley, the AC transit [12 bus](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/12) runs from downtown Berkeley to just a block away from the wedding venue!

All the public transit systems in the Bay Area take [Clipper Card](https://www.clippercard.com/) for payment. You can buy a Clipper Card at any BART station.

## Lodging
Here are some hotels in Berkeley that we recommend:

 * **Hotel Aiden:** this is the closest hotel to shul and is inside the eruv. We have a hotel block—stay tuned for the link to book.
 * **[Hotel Shattuck Plaza](https://www.hotelshattuckplaza.com/):** this hotel is in downtown Berkeley and is easily accssible by public transit.
 * **[Residence Inn Berkeley](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/oakrr-residence-inn-berkeley/overview/):** also in downtown Berkeley.
 * **[DoubleTree Berkeley Marina](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/jbkcadt-doubletree-berkeley-marina/):** this hotel is at the Berkeley Marina, which is scenic but not easily accessible without a car.

There are also plenty of Airbnbs in the area. Look in Berkeley, Albany, and North Oakland.

Let us know if you're having trouble finding accomodations—we can also reach out to friends and see if they have room.
